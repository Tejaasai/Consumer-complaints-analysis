# Consumer-complaints-analysis

Examining and analyzing customer complaints data from leading banks for a regulatory agency's assessment

## Objective: 
To analyze customer complaint resolution data, create a dashboard, and gain insights to enhance the direction of improving customer experience.

## Tools used: 
Advanced Excel (Text, Lookup, Aggregate, Array functions, Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Filters etc…)

## Techniques used: 
Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Creation of Dynamic Dashboards, and Insights Generation

## Challenges:
 
•	State code and state were given Json format converting into tabular form using excel

•	There are few complaints where the given state codes did not match with states so it resulted in complaints with no state name.


## Findings:

•	The Number of complaints increased from 2013 to 2015 and then we can see a slight decrease in complaints for 2016 because company might make some improvements like timely response and all so the complaints are decreased this is the insight we get from the chart.

•	Mostly complaints were submitted through web and very less complaints were submitted through post mail and fax and from this we can understand that most of the customers were active on web

•	Complaints were more on mortgage and debt collections because most of the people opt for these when compared to others.


## Detailed Steps:

•	As part of this project, I analyzed consumer complaints data from multiple organizations and developed strategies to enhance the complaint resolution process.

•	I examined various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as year-on-year changes in the percentage of complaints, timely response to complaints, average resolution time, and monthly trends to gain insights into overall customer experience. This analysis was further done at the state level, bank level, product level, Type of Complaint, Dispute Status, Channel, time (Month, Year, Day, week) etc.

•	I created a dynamic Excel dashboard that includes all the mentioned KPIs with interactive filters for location (state, region), product, channel, issue type, and time. This enables stakeholders to drill down and address specific areas of customer experience.
