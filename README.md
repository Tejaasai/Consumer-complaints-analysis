## Challenges:
 
•	State code and state were given Json format converting into tabular form using excel

•	There are few complaints where the given state codes did not match with states so it resulted in complaints with no state name.


## Findings:

•	The Number of complaints increased from 2013 to 2015 and then we can see a slight decrease in complaints for 2016  because company might make some improvements like timely response and all so the complaints are   decreased this is the insight we get from the chart.

•	The Average time to resolve the complaints has been decreased over time and we can see there is a slight difference in resolution of complaints from 2013 to 2014 but there is huge difference when we compare    
  2013 to 2016 time taken to resolve the issue has been decreased this is the insight we get from the data.

•	The Timely response was good  until the year 2015 and later we can see a decrease in timely response in the year 2016 and if the timely response is not good it might effect the good will of the particular  
  company.

•	Mostly complaints were submitted through web and very less complaints were submitted through post mail and fax and from this we can understand that most of the customers were active on web and there very less 
  complaints submitted through post mail and fax because web might not be available to them.

• From Monthly trend  we got to know that complaints decreased from September to november and the complaints are more untill August and from there we can see the decrease of trend.

• Most of the issues are regarding Loan servicing payments,escrow account and we can also observe that its not only in latest year every year this Loan servicing payments,escrow account is the majority one when 
  compared to other issues.
